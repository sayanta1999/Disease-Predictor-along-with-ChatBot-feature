# Disease-Predictor-with-ChatBot-feature
Built a Machine Learning Model to detect the disease given the symptoms.
The Model was trained using Random Forest Classifier and got an accuracy of 1.0

The ChatBot feature is present in the model which takes the symptoms as input provide the Disease as output
Also Google Search was embedded to get the treatment of the disease.

Currently taking inputs randomly, to give user input just comment out the random input lines and uncomment the user input lines.
